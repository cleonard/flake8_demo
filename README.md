# flake8 Demo

From [this article][1]:

> "[flake8] is a great toolkit for checking your code base against coding style (PEP8), programming errors (like “library imported but unused” and “Undefined name”) and to check cyclomatic complexity."

- [flake8 on GitHub][1]
- [flake8 docs][2]
- [PEP 8 -- Style Guide for Python Code][3]

## Installation of flake8

- `conda install -c conda-forge flake8`
- `pip install flake8`
- `pipenv install --dev flake8; pipenv shell`

## Usage

Run from root of a Python project:

`flake8`

Run on a specific file:

`flake8 app.py`

Run with options (ignoring certain errors, changing settings):

`flake8 --max-line-length=119 --ignore=F401 --exclude=tests`

Options can be set in a config file `.flake8` (see `.flake8-example` for sample config)
